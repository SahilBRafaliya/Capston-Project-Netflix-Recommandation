# Netflix Recommendation Engine

## Project Overview

This project is a **Recommendation Engine** built using **Netflix dataset**. It utilizes **Machine Learning algorithms** to suggest movies based on user preferences.

## Features

- Content-Based Filtering
- Collaborative Filtering
- Hybrid Recommendation
- Visualizations and Data Analysis

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Techniques Used

### 1. Content-Based Filtering

This technique recommends movies based on the similarity of their features such as genre, actors, directors, and descriptions. It calculates similarity scores using methods like **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)** and **cosine similarity**.

### 2. Collaborative Filtering

Collaborative Filtering suggests movies based on user behavior. It works in two main ways:

- **User-Based Collaborative Filtering**: Finds users with similar preferences and recommends movies they liked.
- **Item-Based Collaborative Filtering**: Recommends movies similar to the ones a user has already watched.

### 3. Matrix Factorization

A technique used to reduce large sparse matrices into lower-dimensional representations. It is useful in collaborative filtering. The most common approach is **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**, which extracts latent factors from user-movie interaction data.

### 4. Cosine Similarity

Cosine Similarity measures how similar two movies are based on their feature vectors. It is commonly used in content-based filtering to find similar movies.

### 5. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)

SVD is a matrix decomposition technique used in collaborative filtering. It breaks down a user-item interaction matrix into latent factors, allowing for better recommendations even when data is sparse.

### 6. Neural Networks (Optional)

Deep Learning models like **Autoencoders** and **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** can be used to create more advanced recommendation systems. These models learn hidden patterns in user behavior and provide personalized recommendations.

## How to Use

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb` file) in **Google Colab** or your local Jupyter environment.
2. Run the cells step by step to explore the recommendation system.
3. Modify the dataset or parameters to test different recommendations.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the files manually.
2. Install required dependencies using:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
   ```
3. Open the notebook and run the code.

## Dataset

This project uses a sample dataset inspired by **Netflix recommendations**.
